"""Generate search variants of the 4k entry FROM ONE SOURCE, at screen time.

Five stale-copy failures in one session all had the same shape: a fix written
to a new file while the old file stayed live and reachable. The recorded
mitigation was "variants should be GENERATED at screen time from a single
source, not accumulated as files". This is that generator.

The single source is `nnue_4k/pst_entry.py`, which is itself CI-guarded
against its own generator (`tools/build/check_entry.sh`). Every mod asserts
its anchor text occurs exactly once, so a mod that silently stops applying is
a hard error rather than a variant that is quietly the baseline -- the failure
mode that would make an A/B measure nothing and look fine.

usage:  make_variants.py OUTDIR name[.mod.mod ...] ...
        make_variants.py --list
e.g.    make_variants.py /tmp/bin base cap nolmr nolmr.cap

Names are dot-joined mod lists; `base` means no mods. The output file is
`OUTDIR/e_<name-with-dots-stripped>.py`, and each carries a provenance
header naming the source sha and the mods applied.

    # CORRECTION HISTORY, interior-only. A running average of (search value -

    #
    # REBUILT 2026-08-13. The original prototype (e_pstcorrhist2.py, ledger
    # entry "corrhist: the key, not the correction") was never committed and
    # no copy survives on any machine, so this is a re-implementation from
    # that entry's written spec -- pawn-skeleton key via str.translate,
    # +/-120cp clamp, 7/8 decay, mates excluded, key NOT computed in QS. Its
    # node and nps numbers are therefore re-measured from scratch rather than
    # inherited; the old 0.70x/0.79x/0.89x column belongs to a build we no
    # longer have.
    #
    # Why interior-only is the whole design: computing the key at every node
    # cost 0.48x nps AND made the node count WORSE (0.80x vs 0.70x), because
    # a QS stand-pat score is largely the static eval itself, so correcting
    # it teaches the table its own output.
    #
    # THE KEY IS THE COST, so it is built from as little of the board as it
    # can be. Pawns only ever stand on ranks 2-7, which is board[31:89] in
    # the 120-char layout (rows 0-1 and 10-11 are padding, row 2 is rank 8,
    # row 9 is rank 1). Slicing first is exactly equivalent to translating
    # the whole board -- the discarded 62 characters cannot hold a pawn --
    # and it more than halves the per-node string work. `wkey` below restores
    # the full-board key so the difference can be priced rather than assumed.
    #
    # FUTILITY-BREAK SOUNDNESS (the constraint that cost -449 Elo once): the
    # loop breaks on the first move failing `static + val < gamma`, which is
    # only valid while the tested quantity descends with the sort key. `corr`
    # is computed ONCE per node, before the loop, and never changes inside

    # threshold on the sort key `val`. The break stays sound.
